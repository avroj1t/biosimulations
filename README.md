## About the Project

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that simulate different biological phenomena using numerical methods. The simulations include models such as:

- CRISPR Particle Simulation
- FitzHugh-Nagumo Diffusion-Reaction Model
- Lotka-Volterra Predator-Prey Dynamics
- SARS-CoV-2 Spread Using SIR Models and RK4 Method

- Mathematical Modelling in Ecological Systems
  -Hardy and Weinberg Model
  -One Locus Selection

These simulations serve as educational resources for understanding complex biological systems through computational approaches.

## Notebooks Included

1. **CRISPR_Particle_Simulation.ipynb**: Simulates the behavior of CRISPR particles in a given environment.
2. **Fitzhugh_Nagumo_Diffusion_Reaction_Simulations.ipynb**: Models the FitzHugh-Nagumo equations to study nerve impulse propagation.
3. **Lotka_Volterra_Simulations.ipynb**: Demonstrates predator-prey dynamics using the Lotka-Volterra equations.
4. **Modelling_SARS_CoV2_Using_SIR_Models_and_RK4.ipynb**: Simulates the spread of SARS-CoV-2 using SIR models solved with the Runge-Kutta 4th order method.
