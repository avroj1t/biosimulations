# BioSimulations

A structured collection of Jupyter notebooks simulating biological systems using mathematical models and numerical methods.

This repository is designed for students, researchers, and educators exploring computational biology, epidemiology, ecology, and systems modeling.

## 📁 Module Descriptions

### 🧬 `crispr/`
- **`crispr_simulation.ipynb`**  
  Simulates particle-like behavior inspired by CRISPR gene editing mechanisms using basic stochastic and physical modeling.

### ⚡ `electrophysiology/`
- **`fitzhugh_nagumo.ipynb`**  
  Implements the FitzHugh-Nagumo diffusion-reaction model to simulate excitability in neurons and cardiac cells.

### 🦠 `epidemiology/`
- **`sir_model_covid19.ipynb`**  
  Simulates the spread of SARS-CoV-2 using a compartmental SIR model, solved with the 4th-order Runge-Kutta method.

### 🌿 `ecology/`
- **`lotka_volterra.ipynb`**  
  Models predator-prey population dynamics using the classical Lotka-Volterra equations.
- **`ecological_dynamics.ipynb`**  
  Explores general ecological interactions like species competition and coexistence using system dynamics.
